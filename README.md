## Getting Started

Some modules require Lombok to work, so follow the installation guide linked above. 

Other than that, each module works independently of the others, so feel free to 
work with a specific module or the whole project!

### Installation

To get started all you need to do is clone the repo, and open the module you need.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/geekific-official/geekific-youtube.git
   ```
To build a specific Maven module, run the below command in the module directory. 
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Working with an IDE

This repo contains a large number of modules. 
When you're working with a specific module, there's no need to import/build all of them. 
You can simply import that particular module in either Eclipse or IntelliJ.
